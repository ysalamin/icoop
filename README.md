# ICoop: Presentation

This project was done in collaboration with **[@Axel-2](https://github.com/Axel-2)**.

This year's game is inspired by the well-known flash game “Fire Boy and Water Girl.”
It is a grid game that can be played locally by two players, who must help each other to overcome
the challenges presented by the adventure.

# How to play 
To play the game, simply run the Play.java file located at “ch.epfl.cs107.Play.”

To skip the initial welcome dialogue, press the space bar.

You can then control your respective character using the following controls:

       Action         Player 1, FIRE   /   Player 2, WATER

    Movement:          W - A - S - D   /    I - J - K - L 

    Use object:             E          /          O   

    Change item:            Q          /          U  

    Restart game:           R          /          R 

    Restart map:            T          /          T 


# What is the goal? 
You must find the keys to the mansion,
but to do so, you will have to master the elements,
survive the maze, and defeat the enemies!
