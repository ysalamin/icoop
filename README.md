# ICoop: Presentation

This project was done in collaboration with **[@Axel-2](https://github.com/Axel-2)**.

This year's game is inspired by the well-known flash game “Fire Boy and Water Girl.”
It is a grid game that can be played locally by two players, who must help each other to overcome
the challenges presented by the adventure.
